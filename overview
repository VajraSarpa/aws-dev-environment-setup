- **Best For:** Light development, scripting, small projects

### t3.small Instance
- **vCPUs:** 2
- **RAM:** 2 GB
- **Network:** Up to 5 Gigabit
- **Baseline CPU:** 20% with burst capability
- **Best For:** Medium projects, compilation, Docker containers

### Expected Performance
- **Code Editing:** Instant (local VS Code UI)
- **File Operations:** Near-instant for typical project sizes
- **Git Operations:** Fast (depends on repo size)
- **Build Times:** 
  - Node.js: 2-5x faster than 2012 MacBook
  - Python: 2-4x faster than 2012 MacBook
  - Docker builds: Depends on instance size
- **Terminal Responsiveness:** <50ms latency (with good internet)

### Storage Performance
- **EBS gp3 Volume:**
  - Baseline: 3,000 IOPS
  - Throughput: 125 MB/s
  - More than adequate for development workloads

## Cost Breakdown

### Monthly Costs (USD)

**t3.micro (24/7 uptime):**
- Compute: ~$7.50
- Storage (20GB): ~$2.00
- Elastic IP (while running): Free
- **Total: ~$9.50/month**

**t3.micro (8 hours/day, stopped overnight):**
- Compute: ~$2.50
- Storage (20GB): ~$2.00
- Elastic IP (while stopped): ~$3.60
- **Total: ~$8.10/month**

**t3.small (24/7 uptime):**
- Compute: ~$15.00
- Storage (20GB): ~$2.00
- Elastic IP (while running): Free
- **Total: ~$17.00/month**

**Data Transfer:**
- First 100GB/month: Free
- Additional: $0.09/GB (rarely needed for dev work)

### Cost Optimization Tips
- Stop instance when not in use
- Use t3.micro for most work
- Upgrade to t3.small only when needed
- Release Elastic IP if not using for extended periods

## Network Requirements

### Minimum Internet Speed
- **Download:** 5 Mbps
- **Upload:** 1 Mbps
- **Latency:** <100ms to AWS region

### Recommended Internet Speed
- **Download:** 25+ Mbps
- **Upload:** 5+ Mbps
- **Latency:** <50ms to AWS region

### AWS Region Selection
- Choose closest region for best latency
- US-East-1 (Virginia) - Generally cheapest
- Check latency: `ping ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

## Features & Capabilities

### What You Can Do
✓ Full-stack web development (React, Node.js, etc.)
✓ Python data science and scripting
✓ Mobile app backend development
✓ Docker containerization
✓ Git version control with GitHub
✓ Run long-running processes (training models, builds)
✓ Access from any device with internet
✓ Multiple terminal sessions (tmux)
✓ File editing with VS Code extensions
✓ Debugging with VS Code debugger
✓ Port forwarding for web app testing

### Limitations
✗ No GUI applications (terminal only)
✗ No video editing or graphics work
✗ Limited for heavy compilation (use larger instance)
✗ Requires internet connection
✗ Not suitable for real-time gaming development
✗ GPU workloads require different instance types

## Scalability

### Easy Upgrades
- **More CPU/RAM:** Stop instance → Change type → Start
- **More Storage:** Expand EBS volume (no downtime)
- **Better Network:** Upgrade to larger instance types
- **GPU Access:** Switch to g4dn or p3 instances (for ML)

### Horizontal Scaling
- Run multiple instances for different projects
- Separate dev, staging, production environments
- Easy to clone environments (AMI snapshots)

## Backup & Recovery

### Automatic Backups
- Git repositories (push to GitHub regularly)
- EBS snapshots (manual or scheduled)
- Dotfiles in version control

### Recovery Time
- New instance from scratch: ~30 minutes (with automated scripts)
- Restore from snapshot: ~5 minutes
- Lost work (if not committed): Depends on last Git push

## Security Features

### Authentication
- SSH key-pair authentication (no passwords)
- GitHub SSH keys for repository access

### Network Security
- Security Groups (firewall rules)
- SSH-only access (port 22)
- Optional: IP whitelisting

### Data Security
- All data in AWS (HTTPS/SSH encrypted)
- No sensitive data stored locally
- Regular backups to Git
